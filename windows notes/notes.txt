Installed following 3 programs:

1. loopmidi - this provides a pipe for connecting processing to zynaddsubfx

2. zynaddsubfx - a synth
	
I was unable to load the required instrument "Fantasy Bell" using the -L command line argument.
workaround: made a settings file, "fantasy_bell.xmz" in the zynaddsubfx program directory, which is loaded with the -l command line argument (see desktop shortcut)

3. autohotkey - used to send a Ctrl-R to processing so it will run the ferrous wheel program.

	(Yes, I tried to export an application but no luck- Maybe something with gsvideo?)
